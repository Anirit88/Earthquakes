# Earthquakes

Earthquakes are powerful natural phenomena that occur when the Earth's tectonic plates shift, releasing enormous amounts of energy. They can cause widespread devastation, affecting both human lives and infrastructure. Understanding the distribution and characteristics of earthquakes is crucial for monitoring seismic activity and mitigating the potential risks they pose.

In the context of India, the country experiences its fair share of earthquakes due to its location in a seismically active region. Situated at the junction of major tectonic plates, India is prone to earthquakes, with varying magnitudes and frequencies across different regions. Mapping earthquakes in India can provide valuable insights into the occurrence and patterns of seismic events, aiding in disaster preparedness and response efforts.
